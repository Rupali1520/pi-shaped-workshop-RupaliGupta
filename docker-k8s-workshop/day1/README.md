## ðŸ“˜ Core Concept Questions

### 1. Why is Docker useful in building and deploying microservices?

Docker enables microservices by packaging each service with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments. It simplifies CI/CD, enhances scalability, and allows independent updates and deployments in complex systems like e-commerce or banking apps.

---

### 2. What is the difference between a Docker image and a container?

A Docker image is a blueprint or snapshot of your application and its environment. A container is a running instance of that image. You scale by creating multiple containers from the same image.

### 3. How does Kubernetes complement Docker at scale?

Kubernetes automates container orchestrationâ€”scheduling, scaling, load balancing, and self-healing. For example, running hundreds of containers in production becomes manageable and resilient using Kubernetes.
